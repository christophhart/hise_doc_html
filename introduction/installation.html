</h2>
<p>If you haven't installed HISE already, grab the latest <a href="https://github.com/christophhart/HISE/releases/">stable release</a>
 and come on board! If you want to compile on Linux please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/christophhart/HISE?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-compile-hise">readme</a>
.</p>
<h3 id="system-requirements"><b>System Requirements</b>
</h3>
<ul><li>Minimum Windows 7 / OSX 10.6 /<br></li>
<li>32bit / 64bit</li>
<li>a quite modern CPU (like every other audio software, HISE can be quite demanding regarding memory / cpu speed.)</li>
<li>at least 2GB RAM</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Recommended:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>a soundcard with a ASIO driver</li>
<li>a MIDI keyboard</li>
<li>more RAM</li>
</ul>
<p>After installing you should be able to start HISE either as a Standalone or as plugin inside your DAW. With the stable release you should be ready to go and be able to prototype your first instrument and check out HISE. A crucial part is still missing, though: </p>
<p class="comment">If you want to compile and export your VSTis and plugins with HISE you have to take a few extra steps and install some required software:</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-vsti/plugin-compilation"><b>Setting up VSTi/plugin compilation</b>
</h2>
<p><b>HISE</b>
 itself does not compile anything by itself, but congregates your HISE-project's scripts and files and outsources the heavy lifting to your system compilers. That is why you have to install a suitable <b>IDE</b>
 (Integrated Development Environment) on your OS environment and a some additional SDKs (Software Development Kits).<br></p>
<p>Let's get started: Below is a list of every application required for compiling & exporting virtual instruments with <b>HISE</b>
. They are all free, but some require that you register an account at their company's website.</p>
<table><thead><td><b>Tool </b>
</td>
<td><b>Type </b>
</td>
<td><b>Link </b>
</td>
<td><b>Explanation </b>
</td>
</thead>
<tr><td><b>HISE</b>
 </td>
<td>Source Code </td>
<td><a href="https://github.com/christophhart/HISE">Github</a>
 </td>
<td>The source code that contains the HISE engine.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><b>IDE</b>
 </td>
<td>Application </td>
<td><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/">Visual Studio 2017</a>
 for Windows / <a href="https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_10.3/Xcode_10.3.xip">XCode <= 10.3</a>
 for macOS<br></td>
<td>The main application for compiling native applications for each platform. They come shipped with command-line compilers, so if everything runs smooth you don't need to touch the IDE once.<br></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><b>VST SDK</b>
 </td>
<td>Source Code </td>
<td><a href="https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html">Steinberg Website</a>
 </td>
<td>If you want to compile VST plugins, you'll need to download the VST SDK from Steinberg yourself (for licensing reasons it can't be distributed with <b>HISE</b>
). Grab the <code>VST 3 Audio Plug-Ins SDK</code>
 from their website and extract it. In the extracted folder you'll find a .bat file that you have to execute. The folder <code>VST3_SDK</code>
 has to be renamed to <code>VST3 SDK</code>
 (get rid of that pesky underscore) and be put in your <b>HISE</b>
 source code folder under <code>HISE > tools > SDK ></code>
. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td><b>ASIO SDK</b>
 </td>
<td>Source Code</td>
<td><a href="https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html">Steinberg Website</a>
 </td>
<td>If you are building a standalone application on Windows, you might want to support the low latency ASIO driver. Get <code>ASIO SDK</code>
 from their website and put the extracted <code>ASIOSDK2.3</code>
 in <code>HISE > tools > SDK ></code>
, too. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td><b>Intel IPP</b>

 </td>
<td>It's strongly recommended to use this library because it will improve the performance drastically and it's obligatory for the convolution reverb.</td>

<p>After installing these programs we're almost ready for compiling plugins with <b>HISE</b>
. In a last step we have to point your <b>HISE</b>
 instance to the HISE source-code via the <b>HISE Path</b>
 Setting.</p>
<h3 id="configure-the-settings"><b>Configure the Settings</b>
</h3>
<p>To access the Settings dialog, choose <b>File -> Preferences</b>
 or click the little gear symbol on the right of the tool-bar. Now set the <b>HISE Path</b>
, which has to point to the root <b>HISE</b>
-source-code folder that you downloaded or cloned earlier.</p>
<img src="images/custom/hise-path.png"></img>
<p>Scroll to the Compiler Settings section in the HISE Settings. You can insert your path by hand or select the <b>HISE</b>
 source code folder location with the Browse button.</p>
<p>In the Settings you will encounter many other options to adjust your project. Have a look at <a href="working-with-hise/settings/index.html">HISE Settings</a>
 to learn more about them.</p>
<p>BTW: There you'll also find the Audio & MIDI Settings to adjust and connect your sound-card, drivers and MIDI Equipment.</p>
<img src="images/custom/audio-settings.png"></img>
<h2 id="compile-the-latest-hise"><b>Compile the latest HISE</b>
</h2>
<p>A nice side effect of having installed these tools is that you are now able to compile <b>HISE</b>
 yourself! In this way you can work with the bleeding edge <a href="https://github.com/christophhart/HISE/tree/develop">development branch</a>
 and don't have to wait for upcoming stable build releases.<br></p>
<p><b>HISE</b>
 ships with an adapted version of the <a href="https://juce.com/discover/projucer">JUCE Projucer</a>
 that can be found @ <code>HISE/tools/projucer/Projucer</code>
. The Projucer is a user-friendly application that allows you to deploy <b>HISE</b>
 on different platforms in conjunction with your preferred IDE.</p>
<img src="https://juce.com/discover/projucer"></img>
<p>Open the <b>Projucer</b>
 and select (<b>File > Open</b>
) the 'HISE Standalone.jucer' file that you can find in the <code>HISE/projects/standalone/</code>
 folder. It will present you with compile (debug/release) options for MacOS, Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>Select the Release Version for your applicable IDE and select <b>File > Save Project and Open in IDE</b>
. This will open the latest HISE source code in your IDE (VS, XCode etc..). Hit the <b>Compile</b>
-Button in your IDE (something with a play-arrow) and let the compiler proceed. </p>
<p>A few seconds (and compiler warnings) later a brand-new version of <b>HISE</b>
 should jump up. You can find the newly compiled executable in <code>HISE\projects\standalone\Builds\VisualStudio2022\x64\Release\App\</code>
.</p>
