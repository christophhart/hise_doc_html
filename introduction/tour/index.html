</h1>
<img src="images/custom/quick_tour/hise_interface.png"></img>
<p>In this quick tour we are going to explore the <b>HISE GUI</b>
<b>.</b>
</p>
<p>When you first start up your desktop version of HISE<b> you will get asked to create a new project. Have a look at </b>
<a href="working-with-hise/project-management/index.html">Project Management</a>
 to learn more about its folders and the general architecture of a HISE<b> project.</b>
</p>
<p class="comment">You can save your project in two different ways. Either with File > Save as Archive<b> as a compressed archive (</b>
<b>.hip</b>
<b>-file, which is also the autosave format), or as a human-readable </b>
<b>.xml</b>
<b>-File </b>
File > Save as XML<b> (which is recommended for using version control).</b>
</p>
<h2 id="the-module-tree"><b>The Module Tree</b>
</h2>
<img src="images/custom/quick_tour/module-tree.png"></img>
<p>In the <b>Module Tree</b>
 on the left side of the interface HISE you can patch together Sound Processors, Modulators and FX (<a href="hise-modules/index.html">Audio Modules</a>
) to create the Audio DSP (Digital Signal Processing) architecture of your instrument.</p>
<p>The topmost module is the <b>Master Chain</b>
. It's the root container of all audio modules and the exit point of the final audio signal. </p>
<p>The top-down arrangement follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">tree structure</a>
 paradigm and allows to build instruments with an efficent signal flow, optimized for handling a lot of voices in parallel.</p>
<h3 id="add-a-sound-generator"><b>Add a Sound Generator</b>
</h3>
<p>In the <b>Module Tree</b>
 you can click the "pen-icon" to activate the adding functionality. </p>
<p>When you click the plus icon next to the <b>Master Chain</b>
 you can create a new <a href="hise-modules/sound-generators/index.html">Sound Generator</a>
. Pick something simple like the Sine Wave Generator or the Waveform Generator and click on the newly created module.</p>
<img src="hise-modules/sound-generators/index.html"></img>
<p>On the header of the module you can change it's name (ID), pick a color, mute the generator, set the Gain/Intensity or pan its audio signal. When you <b>right-click</b>
 on the header you can copy&paste its xml data, or create script references with which you can access more internal functions of the module by script. </p>
<h3 id="modulation-chains"><b>Modulation Chains</b>
</h3>
<img src="images/custom/tabs.png"></img>
<p>Beneath the top-bar you can find the <b>Tab-Section</b>
 with the Processor & Modulation chains of the Sound-Generator. Each one of them reveales a chain for adding additional processors & modulators to a specific aspect of the generated sound. </p>
<p><b>MIDI</b>
</p>
<p>The MidiProcessor Chain processes MIDI input and scripts before the actual sound is generated. This includes incoming MIDI Messages, CC Inputs as well as executed scripts. Here you can add a couple of useful <a href="hise-modules/midi-processors/index.html">Midi Processors</a>
, and a <a href="hise-modules/midi-processors/list/scriptprocessor.html">Script Processor</a>
 with which you can inject your own scripts into each specific Sound Generator to finetune its behaviour.</p>
<p><b>Gain</b>
</p>
<p>Via the GainModulation Chain you can modulate the volume of the sounds after the sound generation. You can see that it already contains a <a href="hise-modules/modulators/envelopes/list/simpleenvelope.html">Simple Envelope</a>
-Modulator by default (as indicated by the little <b>1</b>
) to remove the start and end clicks of a raw synthesized soundwave.</p>
<p><b>Pitch</b>
</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the PitchModulation Chain gives you access to modulate the pitch of the generated sound in a range from -12 to +12 semitones(<b>st</b>
). It features the same Modulators as the GainModulation Chain.</p>
<p><b>FX</b>
</p>
<p>The EffectChain is applied at last. Here you can add a bunch of well-known <a href="hise-modules/effects/index.html">Effects</a>
 to spice up your sounds.</p>
<h3 id="modulators-"><b>Modulators </b>
</h3>
<img src="images/custom/quick_tour/lfo_modulator.png"></img>
<p>The modulators for the Gain<b> and </b>
Pitch<b>-chains deserve a deeper look. They represent a generic type of modulator with the task to generate a sample accurate (real-time) control signals to modulate their respective sources. </b>
</p>
<p>When you look at the header of a Gain-Modulator you can see that the "Gain bar" (dB<b>) of a Sound-Generator is replaced by an Intensity bar that shows the values from 0 to 1, and in the Pitch-Modulators a range from -12 to +12 semitones (</b>
st<b>). The Intensity sets how intense the modulation should be applied.</b>
</p>
<p>You can visualise their signal with clicking on the little indicator next the modulators name.</p>
<p>Hit the plus<b> icon of a Modulation-Chain to add modulators from the following categories: </b>
</p>
<p><a href="hise-modules/modulators/voice-start-modulators/index.html">Voice Start Modulators</a>
 (polyphonic):</p>
<ul><li>which set a value directly when a key is pressed and a voice is started. (see: <a href="hise-modules/modulators/voice-start-modulators/list/velocity.html">Velocity Modulator</a>
)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="hise-modules/modulators/time-variant-modulators/index.html">Time Variant Modulators</a>
 (monophonic):</p>
<ul><li>whose signals vary over time and can influence the voice dynamically. (<a href="hise-modules/modulators/time-variant-modulators/list/lfo.html">LFO</a>
)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="hise-modules/modulators/envelopes/index.html">Envelope Modulators</a>
(polyphonic):</p>
<ul><li>who follow a defineable envelope to shape the tone of the voices. (<a href="hise-modules/modulators/envelopes/list/ahdsr.html">AHDSR</a>
)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a few of the TimeVariant and Envelope-Modulators you'll even find slots for modulating the Modulations, which creates the possibility for some quite complex modulation arrangements.</p>
<p>The best way to explore all the features of the Modules and Modulators in HISE<b> is probably to dig in right away and start to add, combine and delete some modules and play around with them.</b>
</p>
<p class="comment">Behind the scenes, the architecture of modules that is built within the Main/Preset Workspace is reflected in the <code>.xml</code>
 file that is saved in the XmlPresetBackups<b> folder. After you have saved your preset as an </b>
<b>.xml</b>
<b>-file </b>
File > Save as XML<b> you can open it with an external code editor to take a look at its raw architecture. This can be quite insightful, especially if you want to understand how to access and manipulate the modules and their attributes via </b>
<a href="scripting/index.html">scripting</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="the-code-editor"><b>The Code Editor</b>
</h2>
<img src="images/custom/scripting_workspace.png"></img>
<p> When you open a new HISE project for the first time, you will see two editor next to each other: </p>
<ul><li>The <a href="">Code Editor</a>
 which an IDE-like <a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace/code-editor.html">Code editor</a>
 for scripting.</li>
<li>The <a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace/canvas.html">Interface Designer</a>
 which helps you to create a GUI for your plugin. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Master Chain</b>
 holds a ScriptProcessor named "Interface". The <b>Code Editor</b>
 shows its "onInit"-Tab. This is the main script in which you can start scripting a GUI or any other interaction inside HISE. Per default this script contains a function to create an interface, that is displayed in the <b>Interface Designer</b>
.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">Content.makeFrontInterface(600, 500);</code></pre>
<p class="comment">You can click the little "open icon" next to the ScriptProcessor "Interface" to open the script and the Interface Designer.</p>
<p>Let us test the scripting. Type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">Console.print("Hello World");</code></pre>
<p>in the onInit Tab, and hit [F5] to compile. This evaluates the script, redraws the interface and prints the message to the <a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace/code-editor.html#console">Console</a>
 beneath the editor.</p>
<p>We don't want to delve too much in scripting right now but it's important to know that even the basic use of <b>HISE</b>
 relies on scripting and learning about it is needed if you want to craft your own instrument or plugin. Check out the <a href="scripting/index.html">Scripting</a>
 docs for more.</p>
<h2 id="interface-designer"><b>Interface Designer</b>
</h2>
<img src="images/custom/quick_tour/interface_designer.png"></img>
<p>Now we'll take a look at the<br><a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace/canvas.html">Interface Designer</a>
. This is the place where you create the interface for your instrument/plugin. In the top-left corner of the Canvas you can find a little pen icon [F4]. With it you can toggle between the <b>edit</b>
 and the <b>presentation mode</b>
 of the Interface Designer. </p>
<p>While in <b>edit mode</b>
 add a new <a href="ui-components/plugin-components/knob.html">Slider</a>
 <a href="ui-components/index.html">UI Component</a>
 by <b>right-clicking</b>
 on the surface of the interface.You can drag the slider around or move it pixel-wise with the arrow keys (hold <b>Ctrl</b>
 to move it 10 pixels and/or <b>Shift</b>
 to rescale the elements boundaries). There is also the option to easily copy & paste the UI Component with dragging and holding the <b>Alt</b>
-Key and to multiselect UI Components while holding <b>Ctrl</b>
. You can delete the component with the <b>Del</b>
-Key.</p>
<h4 id="property-editor"><b>Property Editor</b>
</h4>
<p>On the right hand side you can see the <a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace/canvas.html#property-editor">Property Editor</a>
. It lets you access and modify different properties of an UI Component.</p>
<p>The Sliders <b>ID</b>
 will be "Knob1". You can change it to anything you want, but you should be aware that the <b>ID</b>
 is the internal handle for accessing the component via scripting. So if you should want to change it at a later stage it's quite easy to mess things up. The <b>ID</b>
 should therefore be as consistent as possible. If you just want to change the name of the slider you can do this via the <code>text</code>
 property.</p>
<p>If you toggle back to <b>presentation mode</b>
 [F4] the interface will lock down. You can now use the controls like in a finished plugin.</p>
<h4 id="component-list"><b>Component List</b>
</h4>
<p>On the left hand side of the Interface Designer you can see an overview of your added UI Components in the <a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace/canvas.html#component-list">Component List</a>
. </p>
<p>You can drag the Components to change the z-order of the components from the top (background) to the bottom (front). </p>
<p>A neat way to group several elements together is to drag them into a shared <a href="ui-components/plugin-components/panel.html">Panel</a>
 Component. This makes it easy to structure complex projects as well as to implement page-like UI-designs. </p>
<p>You can open a JSON representation of the UIComponents properties when you press the [j]-Key with a selected element. You can then edit these values on the fly and accept the changes with [F5].</p>
<h2 id="scriptnode-editor"><b>ScriptNode Editor</b>
</h2>
<img src="images/custom/quick_tour/scriptnode_workspace.png"></img>
<p>You can get access to the ScriptNode Editor in two ways. Either you create a <a href="hise-modules/effects/list/scriptfx.html">ScriptFX</a>
 in the FX-Chain of the <b>MasterChain</b>
 for creating a DSP effect, or by creating a <a href="hise-modules/sound-generators/list/scriptsynth.html">Scriptnode Synthesiser</a>
 Sound Generator in the Master Chain if you want to process incoming MIDI events.</p>
<p>Click the little "open in"-icon next to their name to open the ScriptNode Editor.</p>
<img src="images/custom/quick_tour/scriptnode_create.png"></img>
<p>After creating a new DSP-Network you will see a empty container in which you can add new DSP nodes. Clicking into the chain opens up a "Create Node" window in which you can add new nodes and built your DSP-Network. Take a look at the <a href="scriptnode/list/index.html">Scriptnode Node list</a>
 and the <a href="scriptnode/101/index.html">ScriptNode 101</a>
 to get started.</p>
<h2 id="sample-editor"><b>Sample Editor</b>
</h2>
<img src="images/custom/sampler-workspace.png"></img>
<p>The <a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/sampler-workspace/index.html">Sampler Workspace</a>
 is built all around the the <a href="hise-modules/sound-generators/list/streamingsampler.html">Sampler</a>
 Module and displays three of its tabs in one workspace. </p>
<p>The main task of these tabs is to map your samples into <a href="hise-modules/sound-generators/list/streamingsampler.html#sample-maps">SampleMaps</a>
, edit them to suit your needs and finally export the mapped samples into a deliverable file-format that can be shipped with your instrument.</p>
<p>General Workflow:</p>
<ul><li>Put all the samples that you want to map into your Projects <a href="working-with-hise/project-management/projects-folders/samples.html">Sample Folder</a>
</li>
<li>Drag the samples from the <a href="ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/filebrowser.html">Filebrowser</a>
 into the <a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/sampler-workspace/sample-map-editor.html">Sample Map Editor</a>
 and choose one of three options to map them: </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/sampler-workspace/sample-map-editor.html#drop-point">Drop Point</a>
, which places the samples where you drag them. <a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/sampler-workspace/sample-map-editor.html#pitch-detection">Pitch Detection</a>
, which automatically tries to detect the pitch of the samples.<a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/sampler-workspace/sample-map-editor.html#filename-token-parser">Filename Token Parser</a>
, which reads the filename of your samples and maps them according to your requirements.</p>
<ul><li>Edit and finetune your samples with the <a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/sampler-workspace/sample-editor.html">Sample Editor</a>
 and the <a href="working-with-hise/workspaces/sampler-workspace/sample-settings.html">Sampler Settings</a>
. </li>
<li>When you are happy with the map, save it. It'll appear in the SampleMap folder. You can now access SampleMaps with scripting[link] and play them with your instrument. </li>
<li>If you are sure that you won't change the samples anymore you can compress them into the lossless <b>HLAC Monolith file-format</b>
 <code>.ch1</code>
 (per SampleMap). This speeds up streaming-performance and reduces file-size.</li>
<li>In the final step, these Monolith files can be collected and exported together as <b>HISE Resource Archive File</b>
 <code>.hr1 </code>
 via <b>Export > Export Samples for Installer</b>
 to distribute the samples alongside your instrument. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hise-snippets-and-examples"><b>HISE Snippets and Examples</b>
</h2>
<p>By the way: Did you know that it's very easy to share your project as snippet? Exporting your preset via <b>Export > Export as HISE Snippet</b>
 will copy a base64-encoded version of your projects <code>.xml</code>
 to your clipboard. The HISE snippet is also able to embed referenced scripts (<code>include("")</code>
) in the code as "embedded" files.</p>
<p class="comment">You can easily share this string on the <a href="https://forum.hise.audio/">Forum</a>
 (tip: surrounding the string with markdown code-fences (three successive backticks) will make it look much nicer.)</p>
<p>Import the <b>HISE Snippet</b>
 from clipboard via <b>File > Import HISE Snippet</b>
. </p>
<h3 id="snippet-browser"><b>Snippet Browser</b>
</h3>
<p>Under <b>Help > Browse example snippets</b>
 you can find the <b>Snippet Browser</b>
 in which you can save your own HISE Snippets or explore a range of example snippets that showcase a broad range of HISE functionality.</p>
<img src="images/custom/quick_tour/snippet_browser.png"></img>
<p>The Snippet Browser will open a detached HISE instance, so that opening different snippets won't interfere with your current project. You can add your own HISE snippets to this instance and then click the <b>plus icon</b>
 on the top-left to save the snippet to the Snippet Browser. You can add a little description, categories and tags to it.</p>
<p>If you want to check out the example snippets click the <b>cog-wheel-icon</b>
, set a snippet directory and username and download the latest example snippets and assets. </p>
